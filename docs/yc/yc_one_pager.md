# INOMAD KHURAL - Digital Nation Operating System

**One-liner**: A peaceful digital transition mechanism for the post-imperial Siberian Confederation.

---

## 🌍 The Geopolitical Problem
The imperial model of the Russian Federation is in its final phase of disintegration. This collapse poses a massive risk of humanitarian crisis and geopolitical chaos across Eurasia. 
- **190+ Indigenous Peoples** live in a legal gray zone without genuine self-determination.
- **Economic Trap**: Resource-rich regions (Siberia) are cut off from the global economy, contributing to instability rather than global growth.
- **No Mechanism for Exit**: There is currently no safe, legal framework for these nations to transition out of authoritarian control without violence.

## 💡 The Solution: "The Great Migration" (Ugay Nuudelschen)
We are building a **Sovereign L1 Blockchain (ALTAN)** that serves as a constitutional backbone for a new **Siberian Confederation**.
- **Digital Statehood**: A SaaS platform where nations can organize (Arbans), vote (Khurals), and bank (**Altan**) immediately.
- **Peaceful Transition**: Moves citizens effectively from one jurisdiction (RF) to another (Siberian Confed) digitally, before physical borders even change.
- **Economic Integration**: Re-anchors the massive resource wealth of Siberia to the global economy. **AltanUSD** serves as the US-based bridge currency (1:1 with USD reserved in US banks) facilitating secure foreign exchange, while **Altan** circulates internally as the sovereign currency.

## 🏗️ The Technology
I have built the entire stack solo (47,000+ lines of code) using AI augmentation:
1.  **Constitutional Blockchain**: 37 Articles of the "Code of Nomads" embedded in the Genesis block (cannot be corrupted by dictators).
2.  **Arban Governance**: 10-person "households" as the atomic unit of democracy (fraud-resistant).
3.  **CoreLaw Module**: Automated tax routing (0.03% network fee) and judicial oversight (FreezeLaw).

## 📈 The Business Model (Article 27)
A constitutional mandate directs **0.03% of ALL transactions** to INOMAD Inc as the infrastructure provider.
- "Stripe for Nation-States."
- As the Siberian Confederation grows (40M+ people, trillions in resources), this revenue stream scales infinitely.

## 🤝 The Ask
**$1M Seed Round** to:
1.  **Audit & Harden**: I built the architecture, but I need world-class security engineers to validate the cryptography.
2.  **Pilot**: Launch the "Digital Arban" pilot with 10,000 diaspora members.
3.  **Team**: Hire the technical team that can support my architectural vision.
