# Founding Team

## Bair Ivanov
**Role**: Founder & CEO | **Location**: Brooklyn, NY (Political Asylee)

### The "Why" (Founder-Market Fit)
I realized that traditional political methods cannot solve the inevitable collapse of the Russian imperial model. As a native of **Buryatia** (a colonized region in Siberia), I saw that without a technological infrastructure for self-determination, the impending systemic disintegration would lead to chaos.

I am building **iNomad** not just as a startup, but as a lifeboat for 190+ indigenous peoples. My goal is to facilitate a **peaceful legal migration ("Great Migration")** from authoritarian jurisdiction to a transparent **Siberian Confederation** based on digital direct democracy.

### The "How" (Technical Resilience)
- **3 Years Solo Development**: I initially hired specialists but realized the vision required a fundamentally new architecture. I took over development myself.
- **AI-Augmented Engineering ("Vibe Coding")**: Lacking a traditional huge engineering team, I leveraged AI to write 47,000+ lines of production code. I understand every block of the system architecture because I designed it from scratch based on historical nomadic democracy and modern compliance needs.
- **US Legal Status**: My political asylum in the US allows me to build this sovereign infrastructure safely, unlike anyone remaining in the region.
